# AngularNgUpgrade

This project is a sample app to demonstrate the angular ng upgrade capabilities of running angular js and angular latest version together as one single hybrid app.

This project contains code related to how to upgrade and downgrade angularjs components as well as angular components to work collaboratively together.

This project has been created as per the instruction provided within the official ng upgrade documentation provided by google inside the below links

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
